--> Write logic to compare the previous cases and tell the surge
  for example: today's cases are max of all the values and we are in danger zone, if the value is min of all then green zone, if the values are not min and max compare for last 7 values and find min and max and do the same thing. if both the cases are not true then compare with the last three days cases. May we need to write a while loop or for loop for this.
  ->Able to get the max values of the total data with the date. Try the rest.
  -> Able to sort in zones write the code for the difference in the number of cases from yesterday and today.
--> Find ways to apply numpy and pandas
--> Make a plan for next week by end of the weekend.


####Figure out pandas and mumpy for the lamda and test it
--> Build sam template and test it.
--> Use webscrapping to get the county values as the plan B and use Alexa skill development as plan C.(learn about scrappy in python for web scrapping.)
