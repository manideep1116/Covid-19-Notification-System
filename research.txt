#Idea

A project on Covid 19 data using AWS services like Lamba, RDS, SAM, S3 which can send an email and sms based on the logic written in the Lambda. 



# Intial planning

#1) Search for an api online with covid cases in St.louis or Unites states

#2) Write a Python program to get the the date from api and draw an matplot of the surge in the cases
-->Matplot is left.
3) Write sam template to build the infrastructure on AWS cloud with Lambda function and other resources and store the csv file in the s3 bucket.

4) Now, write the Python code into the lambda function which needs to be triggered daily at 7 am and send an sms and email with the matplot graphs

5) Logic in the code should compare the data from previous day's data and tell if it's safe to go out

6) This project should be able to integrate with a Machine Learning model with the data collected. 

7) Use aws quicksights to plot the graphs
 
8) Use Alexa skill development. For example: To read the data in csv file in the s3 bucket if it has the updated data.
