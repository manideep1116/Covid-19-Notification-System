# Covid-19 Notification System using AWS Cloud, Alexa Skill Kit, and Facebook Prophet

### Programmed AWS Lambda in Python, to collect Covid-19 data from open source API's for my State, County and Zip Code and store in AWS S3. Send an alert message with the daily new Covid-19 cases along with a customized prevention message as per the number of cases as an SMS to my mobile phone using Amazon SNS.

### Developed an Alexa skill using Python to retrieve the Covid-19 data from S3 bucket and respond to user based on the request.

###  Forecasted Covid-19 daily new cases for future 10 days using Time series forecasting with Facebook Prophet.
